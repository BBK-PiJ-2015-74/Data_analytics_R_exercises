# Coursework 3 - Regression Trees, classification Trees and Random Forests

# Q1. In the lab, we applied random forests to the Boston data using mtry=6 and using ntree=25 and ntree=500. 
# Create a plot displaying the test error resulting from random forests on this data set for a more comprehensive range of values for mtry and ntree. 
# You can model your plot after Figure 8.10. Describe the results obtained.

# Figure 8.10 shows three values of mtry: m=p, m=p/2 and m=root.p 
# p is the number of predictors in the datasets
# mtry is the number of predictors sampled for splitting at each node of the tree

## Question 2 - Regression trees
# In the lab, a classification tree was applied to the Carseats data set after converting 
# Sales into a qualitative response variable. 
# Now we will seek to predict Sales using regression trees and related approaches, 
# treating the response as a quantitative variable.

# (a) Split the data set into a training set and a test set.

# (b)  Fit a regression tree to the training set. Plot the tree, and interpret the results. 
# What test error rate do you obtain?
# Check here that you don't need to turn the qualitative variables into quantitative: ShelveLoc, Urban, US

summary(tree.carseats)

# Interpret the results: 
# ShelveLoc is the biggest indicator of sales. Shelf locations that are bad or medium have lower sales.
# For car seats with prices less than $120.5, the biggest factor in determining sales is age, followed by price
# For car seats with a good shelf location, the biggest factor in determining sales is price.
# There are 18 terminal nodes so 18 average sales prices that will be predicted using this training dataset.

# (c) Use cross-validation in order to determine the optimal level of tree complexity. 
# Does pruning the tree improve the test error rate?

mean((yhat.bag-carseats.test)^2)

# Gives a test MSE of 3.033, higher than the previous because a smaller number of bagged datasets was used.

# (e) Use random forests to analyze this data. What test error rate do you obtain? 
# Use the importance() function to determine which variables are most important. 
# Describe the effect of m, the number of variables considered at each split, on the error rate obtained.

# Random Forests are a special case of bagging
# By default Random Forests uses p/3 variables for mtry when building a random forest of regression trees. So use mtry = 11/3 ~ 4

varImpPlot(rf.carseats)

# The graph shows the effect of different values of mtry - use of mtry = 11/3 ~ 4 gives very close to the minimum test mse
# Increasing the number of predictors to 9 at a decision point actually increases the error.
# Again ShelveLoc and Price are the two predictors that determine most of Sales.

# 10 terminal nodes - which are regions on a graph that predict, given certain values of the predictors,
# whether customers will purchase MM or CH orange juice

# (d) Create a plot of the tree, and interpret the results.

# If LoyalCH is less than 0.482304, follow the left branch of the tree; otherwise follow the right
# If Loyal CH is less than 0.276, follow the left branch
# If LoyalCH is less than 0.0356, prediction is MM brand of orange juice will be purchased.(Left-most leaf node)

# If Loyal CH is >0.276 (but less than 0.5036) and PriceDiff < 0.05, then if Special CH is > 0.5, prediction is CH will be purchased.
